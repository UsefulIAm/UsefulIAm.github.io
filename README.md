> **"There are two types of companies: those that have been breached, and those who call me."**

UK-based offensive security gremlin.  
I turn coffee into CVEs, payloads, and mild panic attacks for SOC teams.

### 🔥 **Flagship weapon**
[RedTeam.html](https://godnaut.github.io/RedTeam.html) – **One HTML file. Zero mercy.**  
The cheat-sheet that has ended more Fridays than Windows Update.

### 🛠 **Current arsenal**
- `NO NO` one-liners that laugh at Defender, CrowdStrike, and your "next-gen" EDR  
- Rust implants so small they hide in your RAM and still phone home  
- Cobalt Strike → Sliver → Mythic → *custom* because why not  
- Python scripts I promise I'll type-annotate next week  

### 🏆 **Bragging rights**
- Top 5 private bug-bounty programs (they pay me to go away)  
- Retired 4 HackTheBox Pro Labs with public writeups  
- Once got Domain Admin with a single Excel macro and a dream  
- Made a Fortune-100 IR team mutter "NO NO" in their sleep  

### ☕ **Fuel**
Black coffee strong enough to wake the dead.  
Tea only if it's 90% milk and someone else made it.  
Sleep is for people without beacons to debug at 3 AM.

### 📬 **Hit me up**
- Collab? 0day gossip? "Please stop owning our clients"? → DMs open  
- Bug reports → open an issue or just scream `NO NO` at me on X  
- Speaking → yes, but venue must have decent espresso
