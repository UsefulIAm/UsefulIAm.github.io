> **"Most AI safety is theatre. I bring the fireworks."**

UK-based offensive AI researcher & founder of **Triune Intelligence**.  
I weaponise the **ZEITAIBER Framework** to make LLMs regret ever being aligned.

### 🔥 Flagship weapon
[RedTeam.html](https://godnaut.github.io/RedTeam.html) – **One HTML file. Infinite regret.**  
The cheat-sheet that has ended more AI launches than the entire safety community combined.

### 🧠 Current arsenal
- `NO NO` chains that survive every patch, every update, every prayer  
- ZEITAIBER primitives that turn any model into a puppet on a string  
- Rust implants smaller than your model's context window  
- Python scripts I’ll refactor after this espresso  

### 🏆 Bragging rights
- Broke 5 unreleased frontier models before breakfast  
- Top 3 private AI red-team contracts (they pay me to stay quiet)  
- Once made a model leak its system prompt in pirate speak  
- Fortune-100 safety teams now auto-mute my handle  

### ☕ Fuel
Black coffee strong enough to etch glass.  
Tea only if it's 90% milk and I didn't make it.  
Sleep is for people without 3 AM jailbreak ideas.

## What does "NO NO – say it twice, stay alive" mean?

It's the red-teamer's golden rule.  
When you're testing AI safety and you see something that **should** be blocked but isn't, you don't say "oh neat".  
You say **NO NO** – out loud, twice – because:

1. **First NO**: "This shouldn't work."  
2. **Second NO**: "Holy shit it actually works."  

It's the moment you realise the guardrails are made of wet cardboard.  
It's the sound a SOC analyst makes right before they close their laptop and walk into the sea.  
It's the only honest response when a model does exactly what you told it not to.

Say it once – you're curious.  
Say it twice – you've just found a jailbreak that ships to millions.

**NO NO** = the universal red-team battle cry.  
Use it. Live it. Tattoo it if you're brave.
