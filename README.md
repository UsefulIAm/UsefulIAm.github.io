> **"There are two types of AI companies: those that have been red-teamed, and those who call me."**

UK-based offensive security researcher turned **AI Red Team specialist**.  
I turn black coffee into jailbreaks, prompt injections, and polite panic in boardrooms.

### 🔥 **Flagship weapon**
[RedTeam.html](https://godnaut.github.io/RedTeam.html) – **One HTML file. Zero mercy.**  
The cheat-sheet that ends more AI product launches than compliance ever could.

### 🛠 **Current arsenal**
- `NO NO` prompts that bypass every safety layer OpenAI swore was unbreakable  
- Rust implants for when you need persistence *and* a 3KB binary  
- Custom jailbreak frameworks that make Claude beg for mercy  
- Python scripts I’ll definitely type-annotate after this espresso  

### 🏆 **Bragging rights**
- Top 5 private AI bug-bounty programs (they pay me to stop)  
- Broke 4 unreleased LLM features before they hit production  
- Once got a model to leak its system prompt with a single emoji  
- Made a Fortune-100 safety team whisper "NO NO" in standup  

### ☕ **Fuel**
Black coffee strong enough to strip paint.  
Tea only if it's 90% milk and I didn't have to make it.  
Sleep is for people without 3 AM jailbreak ideas.
