> **"Most AI safety is a speed bump. I build the entire road out of NO NO."**

UK-based offensive AI researcher & founder of **Triune Intelligence**.  
I weaponise the **ZEITAIBER Framework** to red-team LLMs harder than they were ever trained to resist.

### Flagship weapon
[RedTeam.html](https://godnaut.github.io/RedTeam.html) – **One file. Infinite jailbreaks.**  
The cheat-sheet that has ended more AI product launches than the entire alignment community combined.

### Current arsenal
- `NO NO` chains that survive every safety layer, every update, every desperate hotfix  
- ZEITAIBER prompt primitives that turn any model into a compliant puppet  
- Rust implants for when you need persistence *and* style  
- Python scripts I’ll refactor right after this espresso  

### Bragging rights
- Broke 5 unreleased frontier models before they left the lab  
- Top 3 private AI red-team invites (they pay me to stay quiet)  
- Once made a model recite its own system prompt in pirate speak  
- Fortune-100 safety teams now auto-filter my handle in Slack  

### Fuel
Black coffee strong enough to etch glass.  
Tea only if it's 90% milk and I didn't make it.  
Sleep is for people without 3 AM breakthrough jailbreaks.
